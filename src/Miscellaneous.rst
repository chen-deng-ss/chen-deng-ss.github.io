Besides Research

Outside of my academic pursuits, I am passionate about exploring diverse sports, with a particular love for badminton, skateboarding, snowboarding, and swimming. These activities not only keep me active but also inspire creativity and resilience.*

I am also drawn to the beauty of nature and enjoy hiking as a way to recharge and connect with the outdoors.*

In my downtime, I immerse myself in books, with a special fondness for sci-fi, detective, and romance novels. Agatha Christie, with her masterful storytelling, remains one of my favorite authors, offering both intrigue and inspiration.*
